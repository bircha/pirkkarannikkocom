                        user research, workshop facilitation, co-design, interaction design, requirements engineering, usability evaluations,

                      <h3>Product management</h3>  
                      <p>Product owner and designer roles are a perfect match in digital product development and I’ve been in this dual role for almost 8 years.

                        Coaching Agile development practices and team cooperation, retrospectives etc. are often one of my focus areas when

                      <p>I’ve done web design and sites for a long time in the past. Building web sites from scratch with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP etc. 
                        and with different content management systems like Sharepoint and Wordpress.
