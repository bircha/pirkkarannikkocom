                        <p>UX, usability and User-Centered Design are my specialisations and passion and I’m a product and service designer versed in 
                            user research, workshop facilitation, co-design, interaction design, requirements engineering, usability evaluations, 
                            competitive analyses and of course usability testing. I follow Agile and Lean UX principles in my work.</p>

                        <h3>Product management</h3>  
                        <p>Product owner and designer roles are a perfect match in digital product development 
                            and I’ve been in this dual role for almost 8 years. I shine when creating product visions, 
                            roadmaps, user story maps, do backlog management and have experience acceptance testing and product customer support. 
                            I can set up product management as a function and develop the related processes, practices and competencies.</p>

                            Coaching Agile development practices and team cooperation, retrospectives etc. are often one of my focus areas when 
                            working on the actual product and solution design.</p>

                        <p>I’ve done web design and sites for a long time in the past. Building web sites from scratch with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP etc. 
                            and with different content management systems like Sharepoint and Wordpress. 
                            Search engine optimization (SEO), accessibility, performance optimisation and web analytics.
